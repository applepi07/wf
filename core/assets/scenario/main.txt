A proclamation from the walled nation of Radista...
"Citizens and visitors! You are well aware of the dangers of the roaming monsters outside that have been plaguing our nation for the last decades."
"We have recently uncovered through our research the ability to grant our Adventurers new abilities that will undoubtedly help in the exploration of what appears to be the origin of these nemeses."
"We hope that through this, we will eventually uncover the root cause of the recent monsters plaguing our nation, and save ourselves of this blight."

You were one of the first volunteers.
As a result, you were given one of the most coveted powers: The power to wish for items.
In return, you were to lead a guild of explorers to determine the cause of the recently-appearing monster, and eliminate the source.
Register your guild, eliminate the source of the monsters, and gain fame and renown as the ones who saved Radista!
